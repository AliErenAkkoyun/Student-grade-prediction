# Student-grade-prediction

A deep learning model using the TensorFlow library evaluates the likelihood of students' grades in their lesson based on how many hours they study, the time they spend on the internet, and so on. This algorithm also shows the relationship between students' habits and their success. Automatically saves the model with the highest prediction success for future use. Thus, at any time, you can predict the success level of new students by loading the saved model.
